### Problem 1 

Show that $|A| = \infty$ if and only if $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = \infty$.

Suppose $|A| = \infty$.
The definition of a powerset states that
$\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ x : x \subseteq A \}$. 
Since there are an infinite number of elements in $A$, we could create infinite subsets consisting of only 1 element each,
$${
    \{a_k\} \in \mathcal{P}(A)
    \text{ for any } k \in \mathbb{N}
}$$
Since there will be infinite elements in $\mathcal{P}(A)$, we can conclude that: If $|A| = \infty$, Then $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = \infty$.

Suppose  $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = \infty$, and suppose $|A| = n$, such that $n$ is finite. Since $|A| = n$, this would conclude that $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^n$, but this is impossible because $2^n$ is finite, and our supposition says that $|\mathcal{P}(A)|$ is infinite. Since $|A|$ being finite would lead to a contradition, $|A|$ must be infinite. Thus, If $|P(A)| = \infty$, Then $|A| = \infty$ must also be true.

### Problem 2.

Suppose $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$.  Since the definition of union is 
$$
    A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}
$$
There is a possibility that all elements from $A$ and from $B$ are included in the union:
$$
    |A \cup B| \leq |A| + |B| = m + n
$$

For the intersection,
$$
    A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}
$$
each element $x$ must be in both sets, so the cardinality can exceed neither $m$ nor $n$,
$$
    |A \cap B| \leq m  
    \quad \text{ and } \quad |A 
    \cap B| \leq n
$$
Which can be rewritten in the form,
$$
    |A \cap B| \leq \min(m, n)
$$
