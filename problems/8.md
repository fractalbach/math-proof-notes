# Problem 1

**Proposition**. For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, If $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

*Proof*. (Contrapositive). Suppose $n$ is not even.\
Thus, $n$ is odd, and can be expressed by the 
equation $n = 2x+1$ for some integer $x$.
Squaring $n$ and substituting, we find that
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        n^2 &= (2x+1)^2 \\
        &= 4x^2 + 4x + 1 \\
        &= 2(2x^2 + 2x) + 1
    \end{aligned}
$$
Let $z$ be an integer such that $z = 2x^2 + 2x$, which allows us to rewrite the equation above as
$$
    n^2 = 2z + 1
$$
which reveals that $n^2$ is odd.\
Therefore, $n^2$ is not even.
